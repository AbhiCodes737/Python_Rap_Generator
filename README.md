# Python_Rap_Generator

This Python script generates rap lyrics using Markov Chains with the help of Graph Modeling of real-life lyrics from most of the tracks by acclaimed hip-hop artists such as Eminem, 50 Cent, Kanye West and Jay-Z. These lyrics have been scraped from the www.azlyrics.com website with the help of the lyricsscrap Python script.

Markov chains are mathematical models that describe a sequence of events or states, where the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on the current state and is independent of the past states. A Markov chain consists of a set of states and transition probabilities between those states. The transition probabilities are typically represented by a transition matrix, where each entry represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another.
